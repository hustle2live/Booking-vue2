### Test Task Description 
⦁	Vue 2: Use Vue.js to create the components and manage the UI.
⦁	Vuex: Utilize Vuex for state management to handle the reservations data and navigation state.
#### ⦁	Calendar Display:
⦁	Each row in the table represents an apartment.
⦁	Each column represents a day of the week (Mon-Sun).
⦁	Display reservations with a solid line from the start to the end date, showing the client's name.
⦁	Consider that for one day, it is possible for the end of one reservation and the start of a second one to occur for one apartment.
#### ⦁	Navigation Buttons: Implement three navigation buttons: 
⦁	"Forward" (move a week ahead)
⦁	"Back" (move a week ago)
⦁	"Today" (return to the current week).
#### ⦁	Reservation Time:
⦁	Consider that check-in and check-out occur from the middle of the day.
⦁	Reservations start from the middle of the start date and end in the middle of the end date.
#### ⦁	Reservation Pop-up:
⦁	Implement a feature that opens a small pop-up with reservation details when a user clicks on a reservation line. The pop-up should display information such as the client's name, apartment details, start date, and end date.
#### ⦁	Git Repository:
⦁	Create a Git repository for the project on a platform of your choice (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
⦁	Documentation and Repository Credentials:
⦁	Provide a short documentation file (README.md) in the repository that includes instructions on how to set up and run the project.
⦁	Include credentials or access details for the Git repository in your submission.
